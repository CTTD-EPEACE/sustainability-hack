TITLE: 
    Efficiently consuming renewable energy from One unique platform

IDEA/SOLUTION: <br/>
     <p> In renewable energy sector, finding power consumption and carbon emmission from different energies are quite difficult when dealing with IT and Non-IT industries, Gated community residential area and government offices. </p><br/>
     <p>Using the MS Sustainability management tool, the platform can implement the below key features to solve the industry problems on Data analytics and management,</p><br/>
      <p>1. A Dashboard to create for industries outlet for calculating the carbon emission and energy power consumption from different regions, locations, number of resources utilizing the power and emitting the carbon every day.  </p><br/>
      <p>2. It should capture the data of number of resources are travelling to office and the mode of transport informations per day, resources working remotely and their statistics on consumptions. This report has the capability to drill down to particular resources to machine utilization in factory outlets. </p><br/>
      <p>3. It should hold the history of  end to end operations details of a particular resources, teams, factory units, manufacturing units, production units, Regional utilization, Global utilization per day from the industy businesses per day.</p><br/>
      <p>4. A template to allocate resources specific to locations for the operations from the management team.</p><br/>
      <p>5. Every day carbon utilization report has to share the information to management team automatically.</p><br/>
      <p>6. Scorecards or indicators to be notified to risk management team in case of risk thresholds breaches from the outlets.</p><br/>
      <p>7. Power utilization report and the required power information per day, per month, per year to run the Industry units.</p><br/>
